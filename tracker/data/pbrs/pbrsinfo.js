const pbrsinfo = `<h1>Pokémon Box (mode)</h1>
<h3>If you've used Pokémon Box: Ruby & Sapphire before, you would probably know how all of this works, but this will help if you forgot anything. Pokémon Box: Ruby & Sapphire are designed for (shockingly) Pokémon Ruby & Sapphire, and so this means Pokémon Ruby & Sapphire have less restrictions and more features than the other gen 3 games.<br>Across the gen 3 games, there are a few restrictions to using the box mode.<br>The only restriction for Pokémon Ruby & Sapphire is that you cannot deposit any Pokémon from a different game into Ruby or Sapphire if you have less than 99 Pokémon marked as "Owned" in your Pokédex. However, the other gen 3 games (FRLG, E) have more restrictions. In Emerald, you have to also have beaten the Pokémon League and in Pokémon FireRed & LeafGreen, you need to have had beaten the ENTIRE GAME in order to use Pokémon Box: Ruby & Sapphire properly. You can withdraw from FireRed and LeafGreen when you get the national dex, but you need to have returned the Ruby and the Sapphire to celio in the Sevii islands postgame. After returning the gemstones, you have essentially beaten the game.</h3>
<h1>Adventure (mode)</h1>
<h3>In Pokémon Box: Ruby & Sapphire, you can go into "Adventure Mode" when connected with a gen 3 game using the Gameboy to Gamecube link cable. The issue with this however, is that it ONLY works with Ruby & Sapphire. Connecting with another gen 3 game will result in the error "You can't go to Adventure with this Game Pak.". This is because of the way Adventure mode works - it is just emulation. Pokémon Box: Ruby & Sapphire have the rom of Pokémon Ruby & Sapphire built in and so it can just take your save file and use it with the rom, whereas Pokémon FireRed, LeafGreen & Emerald were released later and so it can't run a rom it doesn't have. It never downloads the ROM of your Game Pak. This is also why in Pokémon Box mode, the box backgrounds on the gen 3 game side will be the Pokémon Center background if connecting with Pokémon FireRed, LeafGreen or Emerald</h3>
<h1>Pokémon Eggs</h1>
<h3>As a reward for depositing Pokémon into Pokémon Box: Ruby & Sapphire, you can get special Pokémon, of which some have movesets that would be impossible to get otherwise. These Pokémon are:<li>Swablu - connecting with a new savefile (w/ False Swipe)</li><li>Zigzagoon - 100 deposited (w/ ExtremeSpeed)</li><li>Skitty - 500 deposited (w/ Pay Day)</li><li>Pichu - 1499 deposited (w/ Surf)</li></h3>
<h1>Save files</h1>
<h3>As the Gamecube doesn't have a built-in harddrive/ssd, the Gamecube has to use little Gamecube Memory Cards in order to store your data. This means you can have multiple Pokémon Box save files but not all of them on the same Gamecube Memory Card. Pokémon Box: Ruby & Sapphire was originally going to be called Pokémon Memory Magic (in some parts of Europe according to <b id="bulba">Bulbapedia</b>) because of this.</h3>`
